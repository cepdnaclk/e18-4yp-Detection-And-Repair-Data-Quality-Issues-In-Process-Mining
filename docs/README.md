## Abstract

In today's digital age, organizations accumulate vast amounts of data through their operational systems, capturing valuable insights into their processes. Process mining, a burgeoning field at the intersection of data analytics and process management, harnesses these data streams to uncover hidden patterns, bottlenecks, and inefficiencies within organizational workflows. However, amidst this wealth of data lie imperfections known as imperfection patterns, which can distort analysis and compromise decision-making.

Imperfection patterns encompass various anomalies within event logs, such as duplicate entries, missing timestamps, and incomplete data, hindering the accuracy and reliability of process mining analyses. Addressing these imperfections is critical to extracting meaningful insights and fostering data-driven decision-making.

Our project aims to develop an innovative algorithm and accompanying plugin for a Process Data Quality (PDQ) framework, designed to detect and rectify imperfection patterns in event logs. By leveraging advanced data mining techniques and process expertise, our solution seeks to enhance the quality and reliability of process data, empowering organizations to make informed decisions and drive continuous improvement initiatives.
